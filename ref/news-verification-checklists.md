* Is this the source I think it is, or does it sound a bit like them?
* Can I point to where this happened on a map?
* Has this been reported anywhere else?
* Is there more than one piece of evidence for this claim?
* Could this be something else?

https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/detect-fake-news-like-a-pro-2
1. Check the URL. Where is this story from?
1. Read the About page. Are they clear about who is running the site, and do they say anything about it being satirical or full of fake news?
1. If the story has a quote from someone prominent, or from an official such as a police officer, copy and paste it into a search engine.
1. Click on links in the story, and beware of a lack of links or recognizable sources.
1. Do a reverse image search on photos or other art in the story.
1. If the story seems too perfect, too good to be true, or gives you a strong emotional reaction, slow down for a moment.

Tips to Spot False News (2017)  
https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379  
1. Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.
1. Look closely at the URL. A phony or look-alike URL may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the URL. You can go to the site to compare the URL to established sources.
1. Investigate the source. Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their "About" section to learn more.
1. Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs.
1. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from.
1. Inspect the dates. False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered.
1. Check the evidence. Check the author's sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story.
1. Look at other reports. If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it's more likely to be true.
1. Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story's details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.
1. Some stories are intentionally false. Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible.

* CONSIDER THE SOURCE  
Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission and its contact info.
* READ BEYOND  
Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What’s the whole story?
* CHECK THE AUTHOR  
Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?
* SUPPORTING SOURCES?  
Click on those links. Determine if the info given actually supports the story.
CHECK THE DATE  
Reposting old news stories doesn’t mean they’re relevant to current events.
* IS IT A JOKE?  
If it is too outlandish, it might be satire. Research the site and author to be sure.
* CHECK YOUR BIASES   
Consider if your own beliefs could affect your judgement.
* ASK THE EXPERTS  
Ask a librarian, or consult a fact-checking site.

TEN QUESTIONS FOR (FAKE) NEWS DETECTION
http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/learn-channel  
https://checkology.org/ 
http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/sites/default/files/GO-TenQuestionsForFakeNewsFINAL.pdf  
1. Gauge your emotional reaction: Is it strong? Are you angry? Are you intensely hoping that the information turns out to be true? False?
1. Reflect on how you encountered this. Was it promoted on a website? Did it show up in a social media feed? Was it sent to you by someone you know?
1. Consider the headline or main message:
    * a. Does it use excessive punctuation(!!) or ALL CAPS for emphasis?
    * b. Does it make a claim about containing a secret or telling you something that “the media” doesn’t want you to know?
    * c. Don’t stop at the headline! Keep exploring.
1. Is this information designed for easy sharing, like a meme?
1. Consider the source of the information:
    * a. Is it a well-known source?
    * b. Is there a byline (an author’s name) attached to this piece?
    * c. Go to the website’s “About” section: Does the site describe itself as a “fantasy news” or “satirical news” site?
    * d. Does the person or organization that produced the information have any editorial standards?
    * e. Does the “contact us” section include an email address that matches the domain (not a Gmail or Yahoo email address)?
    * f. Does a quick search for the name of the website raise any suspicions?
1. Does the example you’re evaluating have a current date on it?
1. Does the example cite a variety of sources, including official and expert sources? Does the information this example provides appear in reports from (other) news outlets?
1. Does the example hyperlink to other quality sources? In other words, they haven’t been altered or taken from another context?
1. Can you confirm, using a reverse image search, that any images in your example are authentic (in other words, sources that haven’t been altered or taken from another context)?
1. If you searched for this example on a fact-checking site such as Snopes.com, FactCheck.org or PolitiFact.com, is there a fact-check that labels it as less than true?

BREAKING NEWS CONSUMER'S HANDBOOK: FAKE NEWS EDITION 
1. Big red flags for fake news: ALL CAPS, or obviously photoshopped pics.
1. A glut of pop·ups and banner ads? Good sign the story is pure clickbait.
1. Check the domain! Fake sites often add ".co" to trusted brands to steal their luster. (Think: "abcnews.com.co")
1. If you land on an unknown site, check its "About" page. Then, Google it with the word "fake" and see what comes up.
1. If a story offers links, follow them. (Garbage leads to worse garbage.) No links, quotes, or references? Another telltale sign.
1. Verify an unlikely story by finding a reputable outlet reporting the same thing.
1. Check the date. Social media often resurrects outdated stories.
1. Read past headlines. Often they bear no resemblance to what lies beneath.
1. Photos may be misidentified and dated. Use a reverse image search engine like TinEye to see where an image really comes from.
1. Gut check. If a story makes you angry, it's probably designed that way.
1. Finally, if you're not sure it's true, don't share it! *Don't. Share. It.*

## OpenSources ##
http://www.opensources.co/  
https://github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/opensources  
OpenSources is a curated resource for assessing online information sources… a continuously updated database of information sources.  
Our Methods:
* Step 1: Title/Domain Analysis. If “.wordpress” “.com.co” appear in the title -- or any slight variation on a well known website-- this is usually a sign there is a problem.
* Step 2: About Us Analysis. Google every title/domain name/anyone listed in the “About Us” section to see if anyone has previously reported on the website (snopes, hoax-slayer, factcheck.org, etc.) or whether it has a Wikipedia page with citations or something similar detailing its background. This is useful for identifying and correctly categorizing lesser known and/or new websites that may be on the up-and-up, such as satirical sources or websites that are explicit about their political orientation.
* Step 3: Source Analysis. Does the website mention/link to a study or source? Look up the source/study. Is it being accurately reflected and reported? Are officials being cited? Can a primary source be located for its quotations? Some media literacy and critical scholars call this triangulation: Verify details, facts, quotes, etc. with multiple sources.
* Step 4: Writing Style Analysis. Does the website follow AP Style Guide? Typically, lack of style guide use signifies questionable, more opinion-oriented practices, and may indicate an overall lack of editing or fact-checking process. Does it frequently use ALL CAPS in headlines and/or body text? Does the headline or body of the text use phrases like "WOW!!!!"? This stylistic practice and these types of hyperbolic word choices are often used to create emotional responses with readers that is avoided in more traditional journalism and isn’t something that would be permitted or encouraged by the AP Style Guide
* Step 5: Aesthetic Analysis. Like the style-guide, many fake and questionable news sites utilize very bad design. Are screens are cluttered and they use heavy-handed photo-shopping or born digital images?
* Step 6: Social Media Analysis. Look up the website on Facebook. Do the headlines and posts rely on sensational or provocative language (aka click-bait) in order to attract attention and encourage likes, click-throughs, and shares? Do the headlines and social media descriptions match or accurately reflect the content of the linked article? (this step isn’t particularly good at helping us find fake news, but it can help us identify other misleading news sources)

7 steps to better fact-checking (2014)  
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/aug/20/7-steps-better-fact-checking/  
1. Ask the person making the claim for evidence.
1. Look for what other fact-checkers have found before you.
1. Do a Google search -- and then search again.
1. Search the Deep Web.
1. Look for experts with different perspectives.
1. Check out some books.
1. Anything else?

“Baloney detection kit”, excerpt from chapter <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Sagan-Baloney.pdf">"The Fine Art of Baloney Detection"</a> in book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345409469/braipick-20">The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</a> (1995)  
* Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”
* Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.
* Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.
* Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.
* Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.
* Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.
* If there’s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.
* Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.
* Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.

Teaching Aid for Educators on “Fake News” and Alternative Facts  
http://ufsocial.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SourceCredibility.zip  
Story Credibility Assignment   
* Source: where does the story come from? Does the site have an ABOUT page? Does the ABOUT page say what the site’s mission is? Can you find the site’s staff members? Does the site have a physical location and offices where their reporters work? 
* The Headline: headlines are made to be sensational even at legitimate news organizations. Does the body of the story support the headline? Is the headline intended to lead the audience to click on a story but then doesn’t match the headline in tone or content? 
* Author: look at the byline. Who wrote the story? Are they a real person? Does the author have a photograph included? Is the photograph of a real person?  Does the author have an ABOUT page on the site or a biography at the bottom of the story?  
* Supporting Material: even fake news will cite legitimate sources. Does the story link to source material? Does the source support the point made in the story? Often the links go to an official source, but the source material does not support the points made and instead creates the appearance of legitimacy.   
* Check the date: some stories are not fake. Some stories are just old. But these old stories have been repackaged to relate to a current event or are being shared years after the event occurred. 
* Joke: some sites are clearly hoax sites like. Is this a hoax site?
* Are you biased: remember confirmation bias can lead us to believe stories that we want to believe are true. Objective reporting should provide all valid sides to a story. Does the story present just the side you agree with or only presents arguments where you disagree? 
* Check the experts: Factcheck.org, PolitiFact.com, and Snopes.com have already debunked a lot of fake news. So check with them.

Credibility vs. accuracy

Testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, 2017-08-22, p93

Q. And you had talked a bit about prior work and Mr. Steele's performance in prior work and being satisfied by that work. Did you do anything to kind of test and make sure that information he was giving you was accurate?

A. So in the sort of -- I know I'm repeating myself, but generally we do public records work. So we deal in documents and things that are very hard and that are useful in court or, you know, other kinds of proceedings.

Chris deals in a very different kind of information, which is human intelligence, human information. So by its very nature the question of whether something is accurate isn't really asked. The question that is asked generally is whether it's credible. Human intelligence isn't good for, you know, filing lawsuits. It's good for making decisions and trying to understand what's going on and that's a really valuable thing, but it's not the same thing.

So when you evaluate human intelligence, human reporting, field reporting, source reporting, you know, it's sort of like when you're a journalist and you're trying to figure out who's telling the truth, right. You don't really decide who's telling the truth. You decide whether the person is credible, right, whether they know what they're talking about, whether there's other reasons to believe what they're saying, whether anything they've said factually matches up with something in the public record.
