## Daily Dot ##
Here are all the ‘fake news’ sites to watch out for on Facebook (2017-10-27 / 175 sites)  
https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/fake-news-sites-list-facebook/

<blockquote>We’ve compiled a list of 176 sites that Zimdars and the other researchers who created the list rank as straight-up “fake news.”</blockquote>

## FactCheck.org ##
Websites that Post Fake and Satirical Stories (2017-10-27 / 175 sites)  
https://www.factcheck.org/wp-content/cache/wp-rocket/www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories//index.html_gzip

<blockquote>We’ve compiled a list of websites that we know have carried fake or satirical articles. We hope it will serve as a reference for readers who may come across unfamiliar websites.

## Fake News Codex  ##
The Fake News Codex (2018-05-10 / 197 sites)   
http://www.fakenewscodex.com/

<blockquote>This site was created to identify “news” sites that are fake, extremely misleading, or satirical.  There’s no shortage of similar resources purporting to list fake news sites but they are often infrequently updated, politically slanted, or difficult to use.

The Fake News Codex does not include sites that merely have a clear political or ideological bias – Daily Kos and Breitbart will not appear here. We do include sites that are not necessarily intended to mislead (such as The Onion and its legion of imitators), but that can be misunderstood by naive readers.  These are marked with the “satire” tag.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To help you better sort out fact from fiction on the Internet we created this list of websites where we've found  deliberately false or fake stories. This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Snopes.com's updated guide to the internet's clickbaiting, news-faking, social media exploiting dark side.…

So long as social media allows for the rapid spread of information, manipulative entities will seek to cash in on the rapid spread of misinformation.
